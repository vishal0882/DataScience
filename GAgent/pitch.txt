Over the past 6 months, the PPMA Team has consistently gone above and beyond ‚Äî not just delivering features, but transforming how our 
customers engage with us digitally.
PPMA built our own Track Package page, replacing a third-party tool and giving customers a seamless, branded tracking experience ‚Äî no logins, no friction.
 It now gets over 14,000 visits a day, and also opens a new door for product recommendations and upsell.
On mobile, they launched transactional push notifications, keeping customers informed in real time. Over 225,000 messages were sent ‚Äî reducing "Where Is My Order"
 queries and boosting user trust.
PPMA also made login simpler and safer with Google Sign-In, handling around 12,000 logins weekly. This reduced user drop-offs and made account access much easier.
Security was another big focus ‚Äî implemented Invisible reCAPTCHA across key flows, silently blocking bots without affecting genuine users.
They didn‚Äôt stop there. The homepage banner was revamped into a dynamic carousel ‚Äî making space for more promotions and giving the marketing team full control,
 all without developer help.
PPMA also partnered with Data Science to launch the Spark AI Chatbot, handling order queries instantly and reducing pressure on support teams.
Last but not least Product Detail Page redesign improved layout, media, and event tracking ‚Äî creating a smoother shopping experience and enabling smarter,
data-driven decisions.

. Problem Statement
Across multiple digital areas, the user experience and operational efficiency were falling short due to:

Third-party dependencies for package tracking that disrupted the customer journey and limited control.

Lack of real-time communication for order updates on mobile apps, leading to WISMO (Where is my order?) queries.

Cumbersome login and registration flows causing user drop-offs.

Security vulnerabilities with visible CAPTCHA challenges and bot attacks.

Static homepage banners that limited promotional flexibility.

Overloaded support teams due to repetitive user queries.

Outdated product detail pages lacking engagement and actionable insights.
